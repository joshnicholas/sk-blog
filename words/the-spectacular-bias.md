<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p><span style="color: var(--color-text);">We must remind ourselves again that history as usually written (peccavimus) is quite different from history as usually lived: the historian records the exceptional because it is interesting-because it is exceptional. If all those individuals who had no Boswell had found their numerically proportionate place in the pages of historians </span><strong style="color: var(--color-text);">we should have a duller but juster view of the past and of man</strong><span style="color: var(--color-text);">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This is from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/lessons-of-history/oclc/336824">The Lessons of History</a>, a short book that is deeply problematic in some parts and refreshingly frank in others.</p>
<p>This is somewhat understandable given it is more than fifty years old. But the exhortations to not strip history from both historians and ourselves, and so the context within which it has been understood and transmitted, are timeless.</p>
<blockquote><p>To begin with, do we really know what the past was, what actually happened, or is history &#8221; a fable&#8221; not quite &#8220;agreed upon&#8221;? <strong>Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete</strong>, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent evidence and biased historians, and perhaps distorted by our own patriotic or religious partisanship. &#8220;Most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice”.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d argue the same is true for the present. Our view of the world is inevitably shaped by what we find noticeable, what others do, and the context within which this happens.</p>
<p>This could be dictated by the medium &#8211; stories related visually are inherently biased by the availability and power of the images. It could also be impacted by time, technology, ideology, culture and many other factors.</p>
<p>But the spectacular reigns supreme. No one sets out to tell a boring anecdote in a bar. The world, the story, reality, as in history, is probably far more mundane.</p>
