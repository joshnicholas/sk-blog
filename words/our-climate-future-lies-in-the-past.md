<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The shambolic state of climate change discourse in Australia (and elsewhere) has left us largely focusing on electricity suppliers and technological solutionism.</p>
<p>But as American economist John Cochrane <a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2019/01/economists-letter-on-carbon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out,</a> the answer probably lies less in contraptions and arbitrary interventions than old ways of living:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="caret-color: rgb(51, 51, 51); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family" blanco osf georgia sans-serif font-size: font-style: normal font-variant-caps: font-weight: letter-spacing: orphans: auto text-align: left text-indent: text-transform: none white-space: widows: word-spacing: rgba background-color: rgb text-decoration: display: inline float:>&#8230;a carbon tax is the only way to change behavior.</span><strong> The answer to energy savings isn&#8217;t as much new technology as in old behaviors.</strong> Turn the lights off. Take fewer trips. Turn the heat down. Move nearer your work. Carpool. Without a carbon tax there is no way for the average bleeding heart Palo Alto climate worrier to realize that one trip to Europe is like driving a car for 10,000 miles. (Planes get about 80 passenger miles per gallon &#8212; but it&#8217;s a lot of miles to Europe.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to incentivise these behavioural changes we need to make the cost of carbon emissions more salient.</p>
<p>Granted, it <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-our-carbon-emission-policies-dont-work-on-air-travel-99019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won&#8217;t work in every sector</a> thanks to varying elasticities of demand. But it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>Whether or not you think the proceeds should be <a href="http://www.grandchallenges.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/Australian%20Carbon%20Dividend%20Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">given straight back as a dividend</a> (or some other mechanism to ameliorate compounded inequality), it&#8217;s [past] time to tax carbon.</p>
