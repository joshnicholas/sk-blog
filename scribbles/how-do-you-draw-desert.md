The latest [window swap](https://window-swap.com/) sketch. I never even realised
that people lived so close to the pyramids in Egypt. One reason I really miss
about traveling, and Iâ€™m loving on this site, is the contrast between the
wondrous and banal.

Still not very successful with the darks ðŸ¤”. But I think the contrasts are
working with the buildings.
