!['So many orange buildings'](/Romewindowsketch.jpeg)

Second attempt at a [window swap](https://window-swap.com/) sketch using
watercolours. Watercolour pencils this time. Need to remember to use watercolour
paper rather than a regular sketchbook.

There an awful lot of orange buildings in this collection.
