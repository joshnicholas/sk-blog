<p>My name is Josh. I love learning. This site is mostly just bits and pieces of my process - what Iâ€™m reading, thinking; my photos and scribbles.</p><br>

<p>By day I am a data journalist at <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/profile/josh-nicholas'>The Guardian</a>. Before that I covered economics, tech and made some radio for other outlets.</p><br>

<p>This site is over a decade old and has gone through many platforms and stylistic iterations. A lot of content is also being programmatically pulled from other places. Some links, line breaks, quotes etc., may be janky.</p><br>

<p>You can also find me on Twitter, Micro.blog, Goodreads and GitHub.</p>
